If you want to get started with running this application on your local machine, follow these step:

- Clone the repository from remote. You can do this by opening with Github Desktop, downloading the repository directly to your machine, or using **git clone**.
- Open the project and navigate to the root directory in your terminal of choice and make sure that you have nodeJS/npm installed.
- Install the following packages by running the following in the terminal: 
  - **npm i --g serve** --> allows you to host a website on your local machine, just use **npm serve [directory]** to do this 
    - If you get a user auth error when trying the above, use this instead: **sudo npm i --g serve**
  - **npm i firebase** to install the Firbase SDK --> allows you to use the Firebase tools that run the project
  - **npm install webpack webpack-cli** --> allows you to use the Webpack moduler bundler which compiles our Java Script code

You are now ready to go!
