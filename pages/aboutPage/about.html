        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Virtual Mac Community Trade Center, a collaborative project by Team Jachris -
          Christian, Jacob, and Jake. As students of Comp 225 in the Fall of 2023 at Macalester College, 
          we embarked on a mission to create an online hub that mirrors the spirit of a virtual Mac Free-Swap.
           Our vision is to foster a connected community where every member of Macalester can effortlessly buy, sell, 
           trade, or donate pre-owned items. Through this initiative, we aim to build a sense of camaraderie 
           while addressing issues of accessibility and sustainability on campus.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Team Jachris started this venture with a shared belief in the power of community and the potential 
          for positive change. Inspired by the Mac Free-Swap concept, we envisioned a digital platform that 
          transcends physical boundaries, creating an inclusive space for students, faculty, and staff at 
          Macalester. Our journey began with technical research, delving into tools like Google Firebase 
          and exploring backend architecture through Firebase.

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide solutions that enhance the Macalester community's 
          experience by fostering connections and 
          reducing waste. The Virtual Mac Community Trade Center seeks to:

         <p class="bullet"> Increase accessibility to affordable or free items, especially for those who 
          may face challenges going off-campus.</p> 

         <p class="bullet" > Establish a secure space for buying, selling, donating, 
          and trading within the campus community.
        </p> 

        <p class="bullet" > Enable students to save money while ensuring 
          access to essential college items.
        </p> 
          
        <p class="bullet" > Contribute to the reduction of waste on campus.
